Work / Project Examples 

1. SellSite 

For the final project for one of my classes last semester, I had to cread a full stack web application using a stack and framework of my choice. Using this website, a user can create an account, login and logout, post items for sale, bid on items, and accept offers. Users could also see a list of their bought and sold items, as well as rank users who they've bought an item from. Each user could see their average ranking once they have logged in. I chose to use React.js for the frontend and Node and Express to fetch data from a MySQL server on the backend. This class was lectureless, so I had to teach myself React and Express while using what I already had learned about Node from earlier in the semester. The most challenging part of this project was learning React and how to correctly implement the components. This was one of the most challenging assignments I've had to complete while at WashU, but it also ended up being the most fun. I found myself constantly thinking about how I could complete the assignment and make the webpage better throughout the day before and even after I turned the assignment in. 

2. MapThis

This semester, I'm taking a course in Mobile App Development for Android OS. My last project I turned in was an app that allowed users to create accounts and login/out. Once logged in, the user would be shown a map using google play services API. Once logged in, the user would take a picture, and wherever that person was in the world, the app would save that image's uploader, location, and time taken to a Firebase Firestore database. It would also save the picture itself to a FirebaseStorage database. When looking at the map, the locations of all of the pictures of the users registered to the app would be marked by pins, with the user uploaded photos marked with a different color. When the user presses on a pin, a new screen would pop up that would show the picture, the username who took the picture, the nearest city and state, the date the picture was taken, and a button that adds to the number of likes that specific image had. All storage aspects and user authentication was done with Firebase. I enjoyed this project so much, because it introduced me to how useful Firebase could be when building apps. As a programmer, I believe it is essential to use any tools necessary to make my job easier, and I am very grateful to have been introduced to Firebase. 

3. C++ TicTacToe Game

This semester, I decided to take a class that would require me to code exclusively in C++. Before this semester, Java had been my favorite coding language. I'm not sure if C++ has completely taken the cake just yet, because there are some upsides and downsides to both, but this class and this project in particular are the reasons why C++ has become my second favorite if ny outright favorite programming language. This project wasn't as complex or tedious as the others, but it showed me the incredible limits of C++. It gives the programmer a lot more control of objects, with the catch that the programmer has to keep better track of those objects. I just implemented a TicTacToe game using the console to print out the board. It constantly asks the two players for inputs until one has one, there has been a draw, or one player has chosen to quit the game. 


Inspiration 

1. Dwarf Fortress

A friend of mine recently recommended a sandbox game called Dwarf Fortress to me that I decided to try out. This game is so in depth and complex that I almost cannot begin to describe it. It is the closes thing to a real world that I have ever seen in a game. It is a game with no missions, ending, or objectives. You are just dropped into an incredibly immersive world and told "have fun". The reason why I find this game incredible is the amount of attention to detail in the game is jaw dropping. Normally, when I play a videogame, I expect certain things to be unrealistic for the sake of fun, and when those unrealistic aspects of that game rear their heads, I don't think twice of it. However, after playing Drawf Fortress only for a few hours, when I play another game, I immediately recognize the unrealistic aspects of that game. At first, I thought that would maek the game less fun and more challenging, but it made it more fun as well as more challenging. Just the though of the detail in this game makes me excited to play it.
